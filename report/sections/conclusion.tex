\section{Conclusion}

This lab session demonstrated the critical role of \textbf{synchronized averaging} in extracting
event-related potentials. We showed that approximately 40-50 trials are required to obtain
stable P3 and ERN features. We also verified that the \textbf{P3} is parietally distributed
while the \textbf{ERN} is fronto-central. Finally, applying these techniques to the VSTM
task confirmed that these components are robust markers of cognitive processing across different paradigms.
